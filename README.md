# HadesChess

HadesChess is a Java-based chess program that implements the Hades Chess variant. The game features a unique set of
rules and strategies that add an intriguing twist to the traditional game of chess.

## Rules

Hades Chess follows the rules of traditional chess with the addition of the "Hades Chess" variant:

- The game is played on a 8x8 chessboard.
- Each player starts with their traditional chess pieces (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king) placed in the
  standard positions.
- The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king.
- The key difference lies in the rules for the King ("A" or "a"). The King can move to any adjacent square, including
  diagonally. It is not restricted to the traditional one-square move.

## Features

- Play Hades Chess against the computer AI.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) is provided for an interactive experience.
- The computer AI uses an alpha-beta pruning algorithm with a fixed depth to make intelligent moves.
